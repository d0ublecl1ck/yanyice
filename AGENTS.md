- Use 0px border-radius for primary layout frames to evoke a board/ancient-book grid.
- Use 2-4px border-radius for buttons to resemble seals while staying sturdy.
- Use 4px border-radius for cards and modals to reduce visual heaviness.
- Use 0px or 4px border-radius for search inputs; avoid full pill/capsule shapes.
- Use 0-2px border-radius for the overall frame; reserve 4px for key interactive elements.
- Use hairline dividers for separation; avoid relying on shadows for structure.
- Run `bun lint` after modifications and fix all lint errors.
- When given reference images, use them only for fields/layout and UI behavior; do not copy their styling; match the styling of existing project components and pages.
